            <span class="first-letter">F</span>orget everything you know about CSS. Or at least, be ready to reconsider a lot of it. If like me you've been writing CSS for over a decade, CSS in 2020 looks nothing like what you were used to.

            Instead of breakpoints, we can now leverage CSS Grid to make dynamic, responsive layouts that adapt to any viewport size with fewer lines of code. Instead of relying on global stylesheets, CSS-in-JS lets us colocate our styles with our components to build themeable design systems.

            And most of all, Tailwind CSS has burst onto the scene and, through its use of utility-first CSS, forced us to reconsider the traditional dogma of semantic class names.

            Whether all this change makes you want to write a hyped-up blog post or an angry Twitter rant, we are here to present the data, highlight the trends, and hopefully guide you through another eventful year of CSS!

            ### Team

            The State of CSS Survey is created and maintained by:

            - [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/sachagreif): Design, writing, coding

          A quick announcement before the survey results. Introducing our very own üéàüéâüëï State of CSS T-shirt üëïüéâüéà!

          What makes this shirt truly special is that it's the only piece of clothing that also teaches you practical, real-world CSS techniques.

          So whether you're going to a conference, a job interview, or just work, this shirt will demonstrate your CSS mastery like no other garment can!

          The shirt features the State of CSS logo along with snippets of the actual CSS code used to create each shape. Who knows, you might learn a thing or two!

          We use a high-quality, super-soft tri-blend shirt with a slim fit. 
          This shirt sizes small, so if you prefer a looser fit we recommend ordering one size up from what you usually wear (I'm wearing an M in the photos).

          This year's survey reached **11,492** people in **102** countries. For the first time this year,
          we were able to translate the survey questions in multiple languages thanks to an awesome team of volunteers.

    - key: sections.features.description
      t: |
          CSS has seen a surge of new features in recent years, so as you'd expect adoption is
          lagging a bit behind as the community takes its time to absorb new properties.

          We're willing to bet you'll find a few things you didn't know about in this section!

    - key: sections.technologies.description
      t: |
          The CSS ecosystem is going through a renewal of sorts, as older mainstays like Bootstrap 
          now have to accomodate newer entrants like Tailwind CSS. To say nothing of the whole CSS-in-JS
          movement which, while it has yet to cross over to the CSS mainstream, is nonetheless quite dynamic. 

    - key: sections.other_tools.description
      t: |
          No big surprises here, but it's worth highlighting the appearance of development-focused browsers
          like Polypane and Sizzy, which go a step further than traditional devtools.

    - key: sections.environments.description
      t: |
          One of CSS's core strengths is its ability to adapt to different environment, yet for a variety
          of reasons media like print and email remain unexplored by a majority of CSS developers. Might they
          turn out to be the next frontier of CSS‚Ä¶?

    - key: sections.resources.description
      t: |
          The ‚Äúother answers‚Äù results in this section highlight the richness and diversity of the CSS community,
          and feature many outstanding blogs and podcasts which we are looking forward to officially adding
          to the survey next year!

    - key: sections.opinions.description
      t: |
          These opinions paint a picture of a language getting more mature, but also more complex. And perhaps
          ‚Äìat least while we struggle to keep up with the pace of change‚Äì a little less enjoyable?

            If a JavaScript developer writes a line of CSS code, are they now a CSS developer?
            
            This programming *k≈çan* illustrates a clear trend in the web development world: as more and more CSS developers are tasked with learning JavaScript, so are JavaScript developers starting to realize there might be more to this whole CSS thing than just `font-weight: bold;`. 

            So asking about ‚Äúthe State of CSS‚Äù is inherently a tricky proposition: depending on who you ask you might get completely different answers! And how do you know which one's right?

            Here's another k≈çan for you: the right answer is that there *is* no right answer. Each of the many tools, methodologies, frameworks, and libraries featured here has its place in the vast front-end ecosystem. 

            Building a complex React app? Styled Components is a great option. Designing a static landing page? You can't go wrong with Sass! And even though Bootstrap has lost some of its original hype factor, you can't beat it when it comes to sheer number of themes and plugins.

            So while we keep an eye on the shiny new toys popping up on GitHub every week, let's not forget the tools, techniques, and most of all people who have carried the CSS torch up to now. We'll need everybody if we're to keep CSS moving forward into 2021 and beyond!
